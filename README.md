# football-analytics-azure-motherduck

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates a modern data engineering pipeline using free and serverless tools.
The pipeline fetches football match data from a public API, ingests it into MotherDuck via an Azure Function, transforms it using dbt, and finally visualizes insights in Power BI.

The goal is to showcase how to build a low-cost, cloud-native, end-to-end analytics solution that can be extended for real-world use cases such as sports analytics, real-time dashboards, and data reporting.  

## 🏗️ Architecture
